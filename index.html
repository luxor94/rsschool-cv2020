                    Since childhood, I wanted to do programming, but something did not work out. <br>
                    And he went to study and work in another field. <br>
                    But after a few years I came across these courses, then I immediately learned from the friends of the developers<br> about these courses and was pleasantly surprised when they said that these are some of the best courses. <br>
                    And without hesitation signed up. And he began to learn the basic skills of html, css and js. <br>
                    That would be even a little easier at the beginning of training.<br> I was only at the beginning of training and just started learning js.<br> He took courses in javarush, codeacademy, htmlacademy.<br> I’m studying Ilya Kantor’s book “JavaScript” and solving problems from this book and solving tasks codewars.com.<br> No specialty education. 
                    I study at the Belarusian State Technical University at the Faculty of Power Engineering. <br>English in the learning process.
